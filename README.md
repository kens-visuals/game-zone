### What I learned

Well well well, looks like I've got another project to add to my portfolio. This one's a doozy, let me tell you. When I first started, I didn't have a clue how much work was ahead of me. But, as they say, ignorance is bliss. And I must admit, I'm feeling pretty pleased with myself now that it's all said and done.

I wanted this project to be the epitome of a social media platform for gamers. And I daresay I've succeeded in that regard. I used some new toys in this project, like React Query. It's a real treat to work with. I also got to flex my muscles with Firebase and Framer Motion. I also was able to deepen my understanding of TypeScript. I can honestly say that this project took my skills to a whole new level.

Now, I'm not one to rest on my laurels. I've got plans for this project, big plans. More functionality, more improvements, you name it. I'm not done yet. And let me tell you, it wasn't always going to be a platform for gamers. Oh no, this project started as a social media site for book lovers. But I soon discovered that the books API I was hoping to use just wasn't up to snuff. So, I pivoted and here we are.

In conclusion, this project has been one wild ride. And I'm thrilled with the end result. It's proof of my prowess as a web developer, and I'm eager to take on more challenges like this one in the future.
